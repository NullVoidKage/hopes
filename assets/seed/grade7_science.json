Cells are the smallest unit of life that can carry out all the functions necessary for survival.\n\n## What is a Cell?\n\nA cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all known living organisms. It is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently.\n\n## Types of Cells\n\n### Prokaryotic Cells\n- Simple structure\n- No nucleus\n- Example: Bacteria\n\n### Eukaryotic Cells\n- Complex structure\n- Has a nucleus\n- Examples: Plant and animal cells\n\n## Cell Parts\n\n1. **Cell Membrane**: Controls what enters and leaves the cell\n2. **Nucleus**: Contains genetic material (DNA)\n3. **Cytoplasm**: Gel-like substance where organelles float\n4. **Mitochondria**: Produces energy for the cell\n5. **Ribosomes**: Makes proteins\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- All living things are made of cells\n- Cells come from other cells\n- Cells are the basic unit of structure and function\n- Cells contain hereditary information",
